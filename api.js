// If you're using render, when the user refreshes the page, it will submit the previous POST request again. This may cause
//  undesired results like duplicate purchase and others.
// But if you're using redirect_to, when the user refreshes the page, it will just request that same page again. This
//  is also known as the Post/Redirect/Get (PRG) pattern.
// In Rails, when a model fails to be saved, render is used to redisplay the form with the same entries that was filled previously.
// This is simpler because if you use redirect, you'll have to pass the form entries either using parameters or session. The side effect is that if you refresh the browser,
 // it will try to resubmit the previous form entries.
